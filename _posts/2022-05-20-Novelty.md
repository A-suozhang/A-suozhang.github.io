# About Novelty

> 转载自 [Michael J. Black's Blog: Novelty in Science A guide for reviewers](https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/novelty-in-science)

- 公众意义上对Novelty的广泛解释，常会包含：complexity, difficulty, technicality
    - 将Novelty解释为“Beauty”

- Novelty v.s. Complexity:
    - 误解： “The idea is very simple. It just changes one term in the loss and everything else is the same as prior work.”
    - value simplicity over unnecessary complexity
    - A simple idea can be important. But it can also be trivial.

- Novelty v.s. Difficulty:
    - 误解 “technical details must be difficult”

- Novelty v.s. Surprise
    - 误解 “The idea is obvious because the authors just combined two well known ideas.”
    - an idea is obvious after you've heard it, reviewers quickly assume it isn't novel
    - 对reviewer的意见： the novelty, however, must be evaluated before the idea existed.

- Novelty v.s. Technical Novelty
    - A new dataset can be novel if it does something no other dataset has done， 
    - A new use of an old method can be novel if nobody ever thought to use it this way.
    - Replacing a complex algorithm with a simple one provides insight. 

- Novelty v.s. Usefulness of value
    - reviewer的误解 “The authors describe a new method but I don't know why anyone needs this.”， Lack of utility
