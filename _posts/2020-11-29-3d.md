* [Minkowski by Nvidia](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine)
	* [SpatialTemporal](https://github.com/chrischoy/SpatioTemporalSegmentation/blob/master/lib/datasets/scannet.py) contains scannet preprocess

* [torch-point3d](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d)

	* torchsparse

### related code/packages

* [*o3d](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.html)

### Data-formats

* ```pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud("1.ply")```
	* type `Geometry.PointCloud`
	* 一般point cloud直接`np.floor(coords / voxel_size)` - 就可以获得quantize之后的coords
		* 这样相当于直接把对应的点移动到了空间的mesh上(Sub-Nearest)，还有多种quantize的方法
*  `Mesh`
	* with vertices`
	* ?: differenece between "mesh" "grid" & "voxel"


### Terminology

* Couple of data formats: 
	1. Lattice/Mesh: graphics当中常用的一种3d数据存储格式，实质上是一个graph；含了vertex和edge，两者上面都可以有feature
	2. Voxel: 空间中的小方格，但是其实可以内嵌点云或者是Feature
	3. Grid本身就是2D image的形式，每个pixel一个value

* canonicalization:
	* pointnet中的T-Net(然而在后续被发现没有多少用)是做这个，目的是让feature/input空间变得规整，有点类似于BN
	* 类似于normalization,但是不会scaling，会有translation以及rotation

### Features & Terminology

* Sparse Tensor(Point Cloud dara are sparse) 

* also support negative coordinates(?)
* generalized convolution
	* since the in/out is sparse, we must know how the non-zero elment in input maps to the output, **kernel_map**
* sparse tensor
	* use  COOrdinate list format to represent a sparse tensor
	* 一个大的coord matrix C，以及feature vector F
* tensor stride
* coordinate manager
	* generate new set of output coordinates with different order(conv pooling)
	* 在`SparseTensor`中的`coords_man`
		* 当进行inplace运算的时候,参与计算的各个tensor需要共享coords_manager,可以直接丢coord_key就可以不用输入coords了
	* coordeinate key - the hash to index the unordered coordinate manager(share the same memory)
	* caches the kernel_map and cur coordinates
		* reuses the coordinate instead of recomputing the order for series of convs
* kernel_map
	* [[I],[O]] 

* SparseTensor initial requires coord with additional batch indice
	* use `ME.utils.sparse_collate` / `ME.utils.batched_cordinates`
	* 上面的函数的作用就只是给一个batch内的所有的coords加上一个新的dim，BATCH，值为batch_idx
		* 从原本的[num_points, num_dim] -> [num_points, num_dim+1(batch_idx)]
	* 经过这样打包之后的coord和feature才能去initialize SparseTensor

```
coords0, feats0 = to_sparse_coo(data_batch_0)
coords1, feats1 = to_sparse_coo(data_batch_1)
coords, feats = ME.utils.sparse_collate(
    coords=[coords0, coords1], feats=[feats0, feats1])
```

* discretize the continous coordinates

```
sinput = ME.SparseTensor(
    feats=torch.from_numpy(colors), # Convert to a tensor
	    coords=ME.utils.batched_coordinates([coordinates / voxel_size]),  # coordinates must be defined in a integer grid. If the scale
		    quantization_mode=ME.SparseTensorQuantizationMode.UNWEIGHTED_AVERAGE  # when used with continuous coordinates, average features in the same coordinate
			)
logits = model(sinput).slice(sinput)
```

* quantize the coords in dataset
	* use `ME.utils.sparse_quantize`, could use `return_index=True`

* defining dataloader
	* define the `colate_fn` to convert the input to proper output
	* `collate_fn = ME.utils.batch_sparse_collate / SparseCollation()`
		* collation - 整理校对

> in examples/training & examples/sparse_tensor_basics

* data of getitem() of the dataset, before using the `ME.utils.batch_sparse_collate`
	- discrete-coords  - [num_point, dim_coord]
	- out_feature      - [num_point, dim_feature]
	- label			   - [num_point] 
		* contains [N_CLASS] choices of elements

> [Review: deep learning on 3D point clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06280)

* mainly focus on directly taking in the point cloud 
* Challenges:
	1. Irregualr: dense and sparse regions
	2. Unordered: within the same set, no order
	3. Unstructured: No grid, each point independent
* Structured Grid-based Learning
	* analogy from Conv on 2-d images
	1. Voxel-based: discretize into binary grids(has point or not)
		* high memory consumption due to sparsity
	2. Multiview-based: squash the 3-d model into many 2-d grids(as images)
	3. Lattices-based
* Directly operate on pc
* pointnet:
	* plain MLP, no local information
	* simple max-pooling
![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201206225052.png)
* how2 get local information: sample/group & mapping - often approximated by a MLP
	* sample: random sample, K-farthest sampling(sample M times, each points is the farthest points of former), uniform sampling, gumbel sampling
		* FIND THE CENTROID
	* group: K-nearest sampling group them into a local branch
		* GROUP NEARBY POINTS
	* mapping: mlp+max-pool to retain symmetric for orderless
		* MERGE THEIR INFORMATION
* donot extract local info
	* pointnet++: hier applu pointnet
	* VoxelNet: sample T points for each voxel, use their location mean(centroid) into FCN
	* Pointwise Convolution
* explore local info
	* PointCNN: start from pointnet++, apply X-transform on K-nearest points, permute inputs
	* GeoCNN: weighted feature aggregation based on their distance from centroids
	* PAT: gumbel sampling for sample, pointnet for computing + multi-head attention
		* permutation invariant & robust ot outliers
* Some dont follow MLP: thinks it neglects the prior of geometry of PC & large param size:
	* Step func + Taylor expansion
* graph-based: input graph {V,E} V points, E as a {V,V} represent edges

- [KPConv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08889)

* Point cloud - Sparse & Unordered
	* similar but also different from grid: (same) - spatially localized
* Methods towards the point cloud:
	1. Grid-based project sparse 3D data on regular shape(voxelize?), so conv could be defined more easily
		- voxelization is projection in eculidean space
	2. Directly Apply MLP on the points
		- original pointnet dont model the local representation
		- other hierachical methods use MLP as conv, author argue hard to converge
	3. Graph Conv
		- conv on graphh is equivalent to mul on its spectral representation
		- represent edge connections instead of edge relative positions
		- combines feature on local patches, however, invariant to deformations(变形-bad)
	4. Other Point Conv 
		- PointwiseCNN: kernel weights at voxel bin(more like grid-based methdos)
		- SpiderCNN: family of polynominal function applied weighting for each neighbour, spatially inconsistent
		- FlexCNN: linear functions
		- PCNN: also use point to carry kernel weights
* ![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201208224803.png)
* Also Propose the deformabel version of this conv
	- rigid / deformable
	- with learnabel local shift
	- extra regularization is applied to avoid empty set
* Favors radius neighbour instead of KNN during grouping
	* consistent spherical domain
* reception field is a ball
	* inside K points cntains kernel weights
* Aside from weight, a correlation is also applied:
	* use linear correlation max(0, 1-||y_i - x_k||/\sigma)A
	* didnt use gaussian correlation for simplicity
* "fitting reg" - penalize the kernel point and the cloest neighbour
* "reulsive reg" - penalize points have overlap region
* Deformable
![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201208235239.png)

* Point cloud registration task?
	- 点云配准，对齐两个点云空间的变换（感觉有点pose estimation的意味）

* X-Conv
	* ```F^* = [MLP(p_{center} - p_i), feature]```
	* ```X = MLP(p_center - p_i)``` of dim [k,K]
	* ```Y = X*F^*```
	* nearby points `projected/aggregated` into representative point P(sampled)
* Architectural resemble the grdid-based CNN
	* KxK local patched -> K neighbouring points around representative points
	* X-conv instead of conv

	* weighted distance gap

- [PVCNN]()

* Voxel-based methods - regular and good memory locality / need high reso to not lose information -> big memory consumption
* Point-based methods - irregular memory access / huge dynamic overhead
* Combine both - PVConv(point-voxel conv)
	* disentangle fine-grained feature transformation / coarse-grained neighbourhood aggergation(low reso voxel grids)
* Method:
	1. normalize the coords 1st before voxelization
	2. Voxelization: average all the features falls into the grid box
	3. Feature aggregation: 3-d volumetric conv
	4. Devoxelization: (plain) - nearest-neighbour inerpolation, will result in all points in 1 voxel share the same value
		* so tri-linear interpolation
	5. Also leverage a MLP to extract point-based feature

对于ShapeNet分类，只需要1%的label直接训就可以有66%？

Sun-RGBD Detection task - modify archietcture to VoteNet

- Ideas:

use holistic scene is not working, 不再从两个view分别做transform，而直接用reconstructed point cloud去apply两个transform，会明显掉点。

* 🔑 Key:         
	* uses metric learning loss + fullyConv Backbone
* 🎓 Source:      
* 🌱 Motivation: 
	* Towards the low-level geometric feature extraction problem - task as registration/reconstruction & tracking 
	* earlier works use limited reception field - 3DCNN
* 💊 Methodology: 
	* Metric Learning:
		* the hardest contrastive - hardest triplets
		* 2 Constraints: similar features should be close and dissimilar ones should be a margin away
		* ![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201216214619.png)
		* use hard negative mining
* 📐 Exps:
	* Datesets: 3D match on KITTI, find GPS gt is noisy, use ICP to refine the alignment
	* Generate point pairs, then sample the positive/negative pair

- [Searching E3Dcient 3D Architectures with Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16100)

* 🔑 Key:         

1. Prpose efficient 3d block: SPVConv(Sparse-Point-Voxel Convolution)
2. Design automl flow(search space)

* 🎓 Source: MIT HAN

* 🌱 Motivation: 

* 💊 Methodology: 

1. SPVConv

Revisit Point-Voxel Conv(Proposed in the PVCNN): Point-Voxel Convolution:(Coarse Voxelization) - originally proposed to reduce memory consumption(reduce the irregular memory access / improve locality)
However, some small instance occupy very few voxels, cant be learnt well(could use fewer piece sliding window but huge cost)

Revisit Sparse Conv(Minkowski Net): its core idea: skip the non-activated region(1st finding the active map between input/output points)
However, have to agressively downsample to gain good reception field, then the reso will be too coarse

These methods sacrifeices the resolution to gain efficiency

use point-voxel conv: 
![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201223141619.png)

keep the sparse voxelized tensor(only store non-zero voxels), and the full point cloud, transform between them with voxelization/devoxelization
Voxelization: 3d coordinates - floor(x/v) (v is the voxel size); the feature are the means of all points fallen into em
feature aggregation with sparse-voxel-conv with residue SparseConvolution, then transform(devoxelize) back to point representation: interpolate em with 8 neighbour grids

2. NAS Design Space: fine-grained channel num & Elastic network depth

not coarsed grained channel size(expansion ratio in ResNet) O(n) channel space: crop the first c channels sampled
since the 3d model is more memory-bounded, search for depth, sampled depth N, only n layers(the deeper layers may be poorly trained, applied progressive shrinking to avoid)
small kernel matters, but not supported yet, keep all to be 3. 

Evolutionary searching. 


* 📐 Exps:

task: Semantic KIITI Seg, then transfer to Det


* 💡 Ideas:  

1. since point cloud has sparse nature, using dense volumetric methods are inefficient(some efforts already made: octree to reduce memory footprint, MinkowskiNet proposes Sparse Convolution)
2. 3d medical data understaning resembles more with 2-d image, but not like 3d scene unserstanding on point cloud
