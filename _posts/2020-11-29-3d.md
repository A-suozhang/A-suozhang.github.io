#### Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds: A Survey

* 3 tasks: Shape Classification, Object Det & Tracking, Semantic Segmentation
* Data source: LiDAR, RGBD-camera, 3D-Scanners
* Data form: depth images, point cloud. meshes, volumeetric grids
	* point cloud: no discretization(Better representation)
* Challenges: 1. small scale dataset; 2. high-dimension; 3. unstructured natureA
* Available Datasets: 
	- ModelNet
	- ScanObjectNN
	- ShapeNet
	- ParNet
	- S3DIS
	- ScanNet
	- Semantic3D
	- ApooloCar3D
	- KITTI
* ![](https://github.com/A-suozhang/MyPicBed/raw/master//img/20201129200502.png)
* Evaluation Metrics:
	- classification: Overall Acc(Acc of all test instances), meanAcc*(mAcc - acc for all classes)
	- Det: AP(Average Precision): area-under precision-recall curve
	- Track: precision & success
	- Segmentation: meanIOU(meanIntersectionOverUnion), meanClassAccuracy

* 3D Classification
	- Multi-view - convert unstructured point cloud to 2d images
		* project into multi 2d views, then fuse these features
		* Key: how to aggregate the multi-view feature
		* MVCNN: maxpool multiview feature, which causes information loss
		* MHBN: harmonized bilinear pooling
		* Relation network to discover relations between group of views
		* View-GCN: directed graph, graph nodes as multi-views
	- Volumetric - convert into 3d volumetric form
		* Key: 1st voxelize into 3d grids, then apply a 3DCNN
			* Preprocess + CNN: how to find good preprocess
		* Problems: unable to scale well to dense 3D-Data
			* OctTree is sometimes introduced
		* VoxNet: volumetric occupacy network
		* Deep Belief 3D ShapeNets: 
		* OctNet: use hierarchical octree to gen a bit-string representation
		* PointGrid: integrate point and grid representatio
		* 3DmFV: 3D grids further processed with 3D modified Fisher Vector
	- Point-based - directly without voxelization / projection
		* no explicit loss, more popular
		* category: 1. point-wise MLP 2. CNN-based 3. graph-based 4. hier-data structure 5. others
		* MLP: 
			* have permutation invariance with symmetric function
			* PointNet: 
			* DeepSets: summing all representation than transformation
			* PointNet++: hierarchical network to capture geometric from neighbourhood - (sampling/grouping/PointNet-based)
			* MoNet: PointNet-like
			* PAT(Point Attention Transform): represent point with its abs position and relative position with neighbours, then group shuffle attention used for get relations, then gumbel-set-sample used for learn hier fetature. 
			* PointWeb: improve feature by Adaptive feature adjustment
			* SRN(Structural Relation Net): learn structure feature 
			* SRINet: project point cloud to find rotation invariant features, then use pointnet backbone, then graph-based aggregation
			* PointASNL: adaptive sampling - furthertest point sampling methods + local-nonlocal module
		* Conv-based:
			* Continuous Conv:
				* the weights for neighboring points are related to the spatial distribution with respect to the center point
					* on spherical harmonic
				* conv could be viewed as a wieghted sum over a given subset
				* RS-CNN
				* DensePoint
				* KPConv
				* ConvPoint
				* PointConv
				* MCCNN
			* Discrete Conv:
				* the weights for neighbouring points are related to offsets with respeqct to center poin
		* Graph-based - each point is a vertex, the directed edge represents the neighbourhood
			* On Space-division
				* conv is MLP over spatial neighbours, pooling is adopted produce coarse graph
			* On Spectral-division
				* conv as spetral filtering, applying mult on graph laplacian matrix eigenvectors
		* Hier Data Structure 
			* apply on Hier-data structure(kd-tree & octTree)
			* feature aggregation from leaf to root node
	- Summary:
		* pointwise MLP often serve as a basic building-block
		* CNN & GNN are promising directions
			* how to handle irregular data structure is key
		* Efficiency is often a problem


* 3D Detection: - output the 3D Bounding Boxes

	* Taxnomy: 
		* 1. Region-Proposal based(2-Stage)
			* Mult-view based methods
			* Segmentation-based methods(Use segmentation to remove background points, then raise high-quality proposals)
			* Frustem-based: generate 2-d proposal, then transform to frustem(几何体) 3d ones
		* 2. Single-Shot
			* BEV-based (Bird-View)
			* Discreticized: for voxels
			* Point-based: diirectly on raw 3d pointcloud
	* Problems:
		* how to efficiently fuse multi-modality feature
		* extract robust representation
		* long-range detection poor
		* how to exploit texture information
	* Summary:
		* currentlly 2-stage outperform single by a large margin

* 3D Tracking - give the location of the obkject at the 1st frame, estimate its state in subsequent frames
	* use the rich geometric information to overcome drawbacks of of image tracking like: occlusion, illumination, variation
	* 3D version of Siamese

* 3D Scnen Flow Estimation
	* Given 2 point cloud, measure its movement, the 3d version of optical flow
	* point-based most rich information, however no explicit neighbourhood contains in the point representation

* representations forms
	* Projection/Discretization based could leverage the 2-d network architecture, dealing with structured data form. hoewver, information loss

* Current Problems &  Future Directions
	1. imbalanced segmentation
	2. Dense point clouds
	3. spatial-temporal information for dynamic point clouds
